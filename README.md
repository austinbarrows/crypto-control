# CryptoControl
CryptoControl is a program that allows a user to control cryptocurrency miners through a central dashboard. This dashboard allows a user to view real-time information about each miner and remotely restart them and modify their configuration. The software also has the ability to be configured to automatically restart miners when their hashrate falls below a given threshold.
